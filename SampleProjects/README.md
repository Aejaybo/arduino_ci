Arduino Sample Projects
=======================

This directory contains example projects that are meant to be built with this gem.

* "DoSomething" is a bare implementation of a library with a test.  Test files prefixed with "bad-" are expected to fail; this is checked as part of the testing on arduino_ci itself.
* "TestSomething" contains a minimial library, but tests for all the mock features of arduino_ci.
